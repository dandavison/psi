			   The newalg package
                           ------------------

Introduction
------------

The package contains the definitions that are needed to typeset code
algorithms in a pretty way.  The Formatted algorithms follow the style
set forth in the book ``Introduction to Algorithms'' by Corman,
Leiserson and Rivest.

Read the included documentation for usage and examples.

Installation
------------

To generate the newalg.sty file run "latex newalg.ins".  The generated
file can be copied to the LaTeX macros directory.

To generate the documentation run latex 3 times on the file newalg.dtx.
This must be done after the newalg.sty file is generated (Does not need
to be installed into the tree).
